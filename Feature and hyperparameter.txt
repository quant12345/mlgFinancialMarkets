Feature and hyperparameter selection together

Typically, when using genetic search algorithms, I see either feature selection or hyperparameter search for predictive models. 
In the code provided I have implemented everything together. A dataset formed from stock quotes is used (you can use your own).
The result is lists with the best set of features and model hyperparameters(classification is used).
